# Challenge2

This is the read me for Challenge 2

I was given the task to do a portfolio for my future works in which we can work on through out the bootcamp.

As my background picture I used a picture that I personally took in my hometown Laredo, TX.

I added a "logo" part which is just my name with both of my favorite colors.

I also added a navigation bar, which I use youtube to learn how to code it. 

For challenge 2, my acceptance criteria was to create some internal and external links, but failed to do so as I could not figure out how internal links work within the navigation bar. 

I did not add anything in my previous work section, but will do as my portfolio grows bigger (and also i couldnt figure out how to add challenge 1 and display it in the html).

I added my contact info at the bottom of the page with external links which was easy to create/add





UPDATE - 11/6/2022

This is my first update for my portfolio

I deleted everything and started from new. 

Im going to incorporate tailwindcss and jquery (if needed) as my main instrument for my portfolio.

Project 1 - update

I have added the project 1 in the previous work "content."
I've added a link that leads straight to the MunchR app as the user click the picture.

Githup Repo Url=  https://github.com/RyStreet/Munchr
Live Application URL= https://rystreet.github.io/Munchr/


What I'm planning to do between updates.

- adding a theme to my portfolio.
- adding 4 placeholders for next individual and group projects
- add links to my social media
- add a descriptive about me.

Why I started from scratch.

Want to mess around with tailwind settings
I saved the previous the html template in a notepad file where im constantly getting lists, urls etc.
